# Recipes
*A guide to setting up a local recipe database using datasette.*

Using existing datasets of recopies such as [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saldenisov/recipenlg/data) which contains over 2 million recopies, we can pull this data and locally host it. 

Feel free to use other datasets, but the automated script uses the previously mentioned. 

## Requirements
- pipx

> Pip can also be used, just change the line that installs necessary tools.
